    Credits:
    The majority of this package should be credited to Daniil of http://warmspringwinds.github.io/,
     (or to one of his own spiritual fathers). A healthy round of applaud is in place, really.
     
    We at Hailo added some adaptaions:
        - updated tf_records.py to work with TF Datasets (the modern way of feeding data in tensorflow)
        - somewhat improved visualization
        - records creation as script vs. notebook, with some doc
        - Added recordization for more datasets - COCO(stuff&things), CamVid, ...?
